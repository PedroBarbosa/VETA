# This config file maps the tool name 
# to the corresponding annotation field
# in the VCF. It allows to add custom 
# methods, as long as the field exists 
# in the VCF. First 2 column in this file
# are required, where 1st col is the tool name,
# the 2nd col is the VCF field on which the scores
# for the tool are stored. 

# Set the last three if custom tools should be used,
# or if different thresholds of known tool should be
# employed (caution with this, because default thresholds
# in VETA should be fine, as they were manually extracted 
# from literature).
# 3rd column refers to the tool directionality, that is, 
# whether the method detects relevant variants 
# if the score if higher ('>') or lower ('<') than 
# the threshold.  4th is the reference threshold that is 
# used to detect functional variants, and 5th is the tool
# scope ('Protein', 'Conservation', 'Splicing', 'Functional')

# If multiple VCF fields refer to the same tool 
#(e.g. dbscSNV) a comma must be set to use both.
